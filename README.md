HueForge - Color Palette Generator
Project Overview
HueForge is a web-based color palette generator designed to help users create stunning and harmonious color schemes effortlessly. Built for a hackathon, this tool caters to designers, developers, and creatives by offering two modes: Generate Mode for random harmonized palettes and Image Mode for extracting colors from uploaded images. With a sleek glassmorphism UI, live UI previews, and export options, HueForge simplifies the process of crafting and utilizing color palettes.
Features

Dual Modes:
Generate Mode: Creates a harmonized 5-color palette using HSL color space with analogous and complementary hues.
Image Mode: Extracts a 5-color palette from an uploaded image using the ColorThief library.

Interactive Palette Viewer:
View colors in HEX, RGB, or HSL formats.
Copy individual colors or the entire palette to the clipboard.
Adjust brightness using sliders.
Lock/unlock specific colors to preserve them during generation.

Live UI Preview: See how the palette applies to a mock UI in a sidebar, updated in real-time.
Export Options:
Download the palette as a PNG image.
Export the palette as a JSON file for development use.

Responsive Design: Built with Tailwind CSS for a mobile-friendly experience.
Glassmorphism Aesthetic: Modern UI with glass-like effects, animations, and a dark gradient background.
Local Storage: Saves your palette and locked colors for persistence across sessions.
